# Lab 4: Radio Communication and Full Integration

## Overview
One goal of lab 4 was to enable communication between the robot and video controller. After completing this lab, we were able to send information from the robot's Arduino to our basestation Arduino through a radio. This information included the robot's current position in the maze, as well as the position of walls at each square. Once our basestation Arduino received this information, we used the Verilog code from lab 3 to correctly display the maze on the screen.

We also worked on full robotic integration for lab 4. Throughout the semester, we have worked on various smaller projects, including motor control, line sensing, the FFT algorithm, the DFS algorithm, robot detection, wall sensing, the FPGA/VGA display, and wireless communication, among others. The other main focus of this lab was to combine all of these components into one working robot and one basestation in preparation for the final competition.

## Materials
 * 2 Nordic nRF24L01+ transceivers
 * 2 Arduino Unos
 * 2 radio breakout boards with headers
 * 1 DE0-Nano Cyclone IV FPGA Board
 
## Radio Communication
When we obtained the two radio breakout boards, everything was already soldered for us except for the power wires, so we quickly soldered those to the boards and moved on. We then downloaded the RF24 Arduino library and the "Getting Started" sketch, put the radios into two separate Arduinos, changed the channels over which we want to transmit (so that we don't also receive signals from other groups), and the radios transmitted and received without a problem. We also walked around with the Arduinos and radios and played with the power transmission settings. We found that RF24_PA_HIGH suited our needs (anything below that was too weak, but we didn't quite need max power). 

We then wanted to simulate our robot traversing a maze, so we made up a 10x10 array of random wall values and transmitted the message as seen below. Our original scheme involved sending if a robot was detected (r), if the location was visited (v), the walls (www), and the coordinates (xxxxyyyy). For the simulation, we always assumed no robot was detected and the location was always visited. Thus, the scheme looked like the the image below, and part of the code we used to simulate the robot is shown below, as is a video showing the results. We include parts of both the transmitting Arduino's code as well as the receiving Arduino's code for completeness.

Note: This was NOT our final transmission scheme. See Milestone 4 for that. This was just to prove that we could send accurate information over the radios.

## Full Robotic Integration
The last thing to do was to put it all together. 
### Hardware

We had created the pushbutton circuit in a previous lab, but for completeness, we have shown the circuit below. It's a simple pushbutton held low with a pulldown resistor until the button is pressed.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/jg925/ece3400-2019-team10/labs/lab4/pushbutton.png">
</p>

The wall sensors, also working from a previous lab, utilize Inverting Schmitt Triggers so that we could use digital pins rather than analog pins in order to save the pins for other inputs that only work with analog pins. The same schematic from Lab 2 is copied below. We made three of these circuits: one for each wall sensor.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/jg925/ece3400-2019-team10/labs/lab2/images/SchmittTrigger.png">
</p>

In order to detect other robots, we built another simple circuit that is shown below. We used 940nm IR detectors (shown as the phototransistor below) and played around with the resistor value until we had a large enough range that allowed for easy differentiation between ambient noise (i.e. radiation from the Sun and computer monitors) and the emitters that go on every robot.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/jg925/ece3400-2019-team10/labs/lab4/Detector.png">
</p>

The next circuit we needed to build was an LED circuit that would turn on when we finished mapping the maze. It was yet another simple circuit to build, with the schematic shown below. The green LED is controlled by the Arduino rather than always being at +5V, unlike the previous circuits shown above. 

This circuit is exactly the same as our four IR emitter circuits, except that the IR LEDs are powered by +5V rather than the Arduino output.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/jg925/ece3400-2019-team10/labs/lab4/LED.png">
</p>

The final thing we needed to add hardware-wise was support for our fast servos. Powering them off +5V from the Arduino just wasn't going to cut it. Thus, we used a 9V battery for each servo. The circuit isn't drawn here because it's the same thing as powering regular servos, but we wanted to make note that we wired the ground of the battery to the Arduino ground so that we had a common ground, and the +9V terminal went to the power wire on the Servo. The signal that went through the 330Î© resistor from the Arduino to the control wire remained exactly the same.

### Software

The software proved far more difficult than anticipated despite the hardware working properly. We integrated the software incrementally in order to aid in the debugging process. 

#### DFS Algorithm

The first thing we did was completely revamp our DFS algorithm. As noted in the previous milestone, the TAs told us that using recursion and additional data structures like a stack array would probably cause us to run out of memory and cause our robot to fail. Thus, we wrote an iterative DFS using only structs that we defined. Similar to Milestone 3, we created a node struct that holds the position and direction that we always use to keep track of our current location and orientation, and a maze struct that holds a visited bit, a sent bit (for radio communication), and the direction the robot came from in order to reach that location, as well as the location of walls and navigable neighbors around the location. All of these fields use bytes so we can save space. The maze struct is used to make an 81 element array (because the final competition has mazes that are 9x9), with each element representing the location of a square in the maze. Part of the code is shown below. 

It is an iterative DFS, so we call dfs() once every time loop gets called. We only want to start moving if the button is pressed so that's why we have that first conditional in loop. Once the button is pressed, then we want to start the dfs. Then in dfs, we determine our current position and the walls around us, change the neighbors to recognize that we've visited the location, determine if we're done mapping the maze, and then look to move. If we can move, then we do; otherwise, we walk back using the information we've saved into the maze. Finally, in loop, when we return to (0,0), we halt. This integrates many things already: the DFS algorithm, the line sensors, the wall sensors, the green done LED, and the pushbutton. A video is shown below the code of this code working on a 4x4 maze.

```c
#define maze_size 81

struct node {
  byte pos; // xxxxyyyy
  byte dir; // 0000NESW, where only one of NESW can be a 1
};

struct box {
  byte vs_came; // vs00NESW, tells if visited with v bit, the walls were sent with the s bit,
                // and which direction we came from (where only one of NESW can be a 1)

  byte walls_neighbors; // wwwwnnnn, tells where walls are (using cardinal directions) with wwww, 
                        // where is available to move/not move with nnnn (using cardinal directions)
                        // when nnnn is 1111, everywhere has been traversed and/or there are walls
                        // so we will backtrack.
};

box maze[maze_size];
node current;

void dfs() {
  byte location = current.pos;

  // determine the walls around the current location
  determineWalls(location);

  // set all neighbors such that location is now unnavigable (to avoid repeats)
  determineNav(location);

  if (determineDone()) { // if we've navigated everywhere we can, turn the done LED on.
    digitalWrite(DONE_LED, HIGH);
  }

  int wemoved = 1;
  
  // if everywhere isn't unnavigable around location
  if ((maze[int(location & B00001111) * 9 + int(location >> 4)].walls_neighbors & B00001111) != 15) {

    // Now move based on movement priority:
    // try in front of us, then to left, then to right, then behind

    if (int(current.dir) == 8) { // facing north
      if (!moveNorth()) {
        if (!moveWest()) {
          if (!moveEast()) {
            wemoved = moveSouth();
          }
        }
      }
    } 
    // Similar code for other three directions
  } else { // if all neighbors are unnavigable
    wemoved = 0;
  }

  if (!wemoved && current.pos != 0) { // if we didn't move, 
  // i.e. all neighbors have been visited and/or have walls, and we aren't at the start
    walkBack();
  }
}

... // setup and DFS helpers

void loop() {
  if (beginning) { // wait for pushbutton
    if (digitalRead(START_BUTTON)) { 
      for (int i=0; i<2; i++) { // for debugging purposes
        digitalWrite(DONE_LED,HIGH);
        delay(500);
        digitalWrite(DONE_LED,LOW);
        delay(500);
      }
      dfs();
      beginning = 0; // stop calling fft if 950 Hz detected or button pressed
    }
  } else if (!ending) { // to make sure we don't keep doing stuff after we finish
    dfs();
  } else { // Permanently halt at (0,0) when done.
    halt();
  }
}
```

#### FFT Algorithm

Although we implemented the FFT algorithm that was able to detect 950 Hz earlier in the semester. We found that although our robot was able to detect signals at 950 Hz, it was also very susceptible to noise, which potentially could lead to false starts in the competition. Also, we used a tone generator to collect data that allowed us to determine thresholds for each bin, and collected ambient noise data in the lab. This meant that our algorithm worked well when we used that specific tone generator in the lab in Phillips Hall, but not in other situations. To resolve this, we collected data using the same setup we expected our robot to be in during the competition. We collected data from many samples, with a 950 Hz tone, a 850 Hz tone, a 1050 Hz tone, and finally ambient noise. For the ambient noise, we collected data in Duffield Hall when students were present, since this was closer to the conditions we exppected the robot to encounter in the competition. By analyzing all of this data we were able to develop a pretty simple function to determine which tone was being played based on the values in just three FFT bins. 

```c
int freq_detect( int five, int six, int seven ) {
  return ( six > 122 && six < 137 && seven > 120 && seven < 126 && five < 100 ); // digital filter on fft output
}
```

The first four parts in the return statement were threshold values we determined for the sixth and seventh FFT bin. After we ran just this code, we found that it worked very well for 950, but sometimes incorrectly detected 850 Hz. To fix this, we included data from the fifth FFT bin. Since the FFT output of 850 Hz is shifted lower than 950 Hz, we determined that if the fifth bin was above 100, we wanted to ignore it to prevent incorrect detections.

#### Robot Detection

The last thing we integrated was robot detection. After switching out the wide angle phototransistor and mounting the narrow angled one at exactly 5 inches off the ground, we re-calibrated our detector thresholds. The next part we worked on was combining robot detection with dfs. Our implementation of this was split into two parts: detecting a robot within a call to dfs and within a call to walkBack.

While within a call to dfs, if we detect a robot, we stop our current move to the next node and walk back without marking the current node as visited. By not marking the node as visited, our robot will eventually re-explore that node with our dfs, just at a different point in time.

```
if (detect_robots()) {
    robot_detected = 1;
    return 0;
}
```

<p align="center">

</p>

As the above video demonstrates, our robot avoids the 'fake robot' and moves to the next available node. If there were no available nodes, our robot would've turned around and backtracked.

The harder part to implement was what to do when detecting a robot within a call to walkBack since we couldn't call walkBack within another walkBack call without causing serious memory issues. So in order to work around this problem, we decided to implement a hardcoded avoidance method that wouldn't mess up our dfs algorithm. After detecting a robot within walkBack, the robot finds a short 3 node path that doesn't update the maze to take that would ensure we are out of the other robot's way. Once we finish the short detour, we trace back our steps and move to the exact location where we originally detected the other robot and continue dfs. This way, we completely avoid the other robot while maintaining our position in the algorithm and our maze.

In the following video, our robot accurately avoids the 'fake robot' while still exploring every node in the maze.

Below is the code we added in order to implement walkBack robot avoidance.

## Conclusion
