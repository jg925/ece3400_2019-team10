# Lab 1: Microcontroller

## Overview
The goal of Lab 1 was to accustom us to the many functionalities of the Arduino UNO 
and the Arduino IDE, such as using analog and digital input/outputs and driving 
peripheral devices (LED, Servos, etc). The finished product was to create 
an assembled robot that drives autonomously.


### Materials
* 1 Arduino Uno
* 1 USB A/B Cable
* 1 Continuous rotation servos
* 1 Pushbutton
* 1 LED (red)
* 1 Potentiometer
* Several resistors (kΩ range)
* 1 Solderless breadboard

## Using and Modifying the Blink Sketch

The first task was to use the provided Blink example code to light up an internal LED for 1 second 
and turn it off for 1 second, looping repeatedly. A video is displayed below showing the results.

Next, we took the Blink sketch and modified it to light up an external red LED.
To do this, we placed a red LED on the breadboard, wired it through a 330Ω resistor to limit the current through the LED,
and connected it to an output pin on the Arduino. We also changed the setup function. The final code is displayed below, along with a video showing the results.

```c
// A simple Arduino program to make an external LED blink

int EXTERNAL_LED = 13;
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(EXTERNAL_LED, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(EXTERNAL_LED, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(EXTERNAL_LED, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
}
```

## Reading from a Potentiometer

In the second section of the lab, we were tasked with using a potentiometer to figure out 
how to operate the analog input ports of the Arduino. We first wired up the potentiometer as shown in the following picture: power to 5V, ground to ground, and the output signal through a parallel combination of 330Ω resistors. The resistor that connects to ground acts as the other half of a voltage divider, while the resistor that connects to an analog input port on the Arduino board acts as a current limiter. A simple schematic is shown below. We then tested the output readings through serial communication. A snippet of the output stream printed to COM3 as we turned the potentiometer is shown below.

```c
// This program allows us to continuous read the voltage across a voltage divider by alternating the potentiometer

int VOLT_DIVIDE = A0;

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin VOLT_DIVIDE as an output.
  pinMode(VOLT_DIVIDE, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  Serial.println(analogRead(VOLT_DIVIDE));    // Print out the value being read from the analog pin
  delay(500);                                 // wait for half a second
}
```

We were also tasked with adjusting the brightness of an LED with the potentiometer.
A clip of that is shown below, along with the modified code that was used.

```c
// This program allows us to control the brightness of an LED by turning the potentiometer

int VOLT_DIVIDE = A5;
int LED = 3;
int v = 0;

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(VOLT_DIVIDE, INPUT);
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  v = analogRead(VOLT_DIVIDE);
  analogWrite(LED, v/2);
}
```
## Driving a Servos
In this next portion of the lab, we were tasked with driving a servos using the Arduino UNO.
The Servos motors would be the motors running the wheels of our robot later on.

After testing the Servos alone, we used a potentiometer to adjust the speed and direction 
at which the Servos motor was rotating.
