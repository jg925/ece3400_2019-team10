# Lab 1: Microcontroller

## Overview
The goal of Lab 1 was to accustom us to the many functionalities of the Arduino UNO 
and the Arduino IDE, such as using analog and digital input/outputs and driving 
peripheral devices (LED, Servos, etc). The finished product was to create 
an assembled robot that drives autonomously.
