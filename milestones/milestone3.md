# Milestone 3: Avoiding Robots and Traversing Mazes

## Introduction

This milestone involved having our robot successfully avoid other robots and explore a unique 4x5 maze with some algorithm such as DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, or A*. For this milestone, we relied on the Arduino code and hardware that we set up in previous labs throughout the semester, specifically line following and wall detection. In order to detect other robots, we tested different IR emitters and detectors and eventually chose to go with the wider angle detectors and the shorter ranged emitters, mounting three detectors and four emitters at exactly 5 inches off the ground. For maze exploration, we decided to implement a DFS algorithm which involved utilizing stacks and recursion.

## Maze Exploration

In this section of the milestone, we implemented a depth-first search in order to successfully traverse a 4x5 maze. In order to implement this algorithm, we used the StackArray Arduino library. We created an enum called direction as well as a struct called node that keeps track of the robot's orientation and position. We used bytes to store the position to save space; the first four bits are for the x-coordinate and the last four are for the y-coordinate. We created another struct that we used to create a 100 element array to simulate the 10x10 maze. This node contains two bytes which tell if the location has been visited and where the walls are relative to where to robot entered the position. We initially set all the walls to be 00000111 in setup() because we use shifting to properly set the bits once we determine the locations using the wall sensors. When placing our robot into the corner of a maze, we always say it starts at (0,0) and that it is always facing north, so we always place it such that there are walls to the left and behind it as shown below. This greatly simplified the start-up code. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/jg925/ece3400-2019-team10/blob/master/labs/lab3/images/RobotInit.png?raw=true" height="300" width="500"></p>

When loop() is called for the first time, we wait for the button that we integrated to be pressed. Then we check if (0,1) is open and we call dfs() on that location. Our DFS is a little more complicated than that of a "standard" DFS because we always have to take the robot's orientation into account. First, we move to the open location, push it onto the stack, and determine where the walls are, modifying the byte in our maze array as needed. Then we determine the coordinates of the neighbors, save the current orientation, and look to recursively call DFS on the location in front of the robot if there isn't a wall, if it isn't visited, and it's in the maze. Then, depending on the orientation after that, we read the appropriate wall sensor to check the location to the left of the original orientation, check the coordinate to see if it's navigable, and move so if necessary. Finally, we execute a similar process for the location to the right of the original orientation. After all that, we pop the current location of the stack and return to the previous location (if there is a location to return to). After that front DFS finally completes, we look back into loop(), and do the same thing. Again, because orientation matters, it gets a little more complicated determining which sensor to read from and where to turn. After both of those paths have been explored fully (or determined to be unexplorable), we return to our starting location, face north, halt the robot, and turn on our victory LED.

A video showing our robot navigating a complex 4x5 maze along with part of our code is shown below.
