# Milestone 3: Avoiding Robots and Traversing Mazes

## Introduction

Milestone 3 involved having our robot successfully avoid other robots and explore a unique 4x5 maze with some algorithm such as DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, or A*. For this milestone, we relied on the Arduino code and hardware that we set up in previous labs throughout the semester, specifically line following and wall detection. In order to detect other robots, we tested different IR emitters and detectors and eventually chose to go with the wider angle detectors and the shorter ranged emitters, mounting three detectors and four emitters at exactly 5 inches off the ground. For maze exploration, we decided to implement a DFS algorithm which involved utilizing stacks and recursion.
