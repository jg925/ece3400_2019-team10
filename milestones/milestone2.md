# Milestone 2: Wall Following

## Introduction

The milestone that was achieved involved having our robot first successfully circle an arbitrary set of walls and then demonstrate that our robot does line tracking and avoids walls at the same time. In order to reach this milestone, we had to rely on the Arduino coding and breadboard wiring skills learned in Labs 1 and 2 to utilize input from line sensors as well as infrared wall sensors to ensure the robot stayed on track while not hitting a wall. We chose to use three IR sensors, and attached them beneath the top platform. We made sure to place them such that they are approximately at right angles from each other. You can see our placement in the photo below.

Joy and Dan were the two that worked on this milestone. Jinny and Ryan worked on the FFT analysis of Lab 2 during this time. They also began working on the robot detection section of this milestone before that part was switched to Milestone 3.

## Wall Following

This milestone was extremely easy because of the work we completed in Lab 2. Our Schmitt Triggers convert the analog output from the IR sensors into a digital 0 or 1 and this allowed us to use a series of simple if-statements to check for certain conditions to be met (and also allowed us to free up three analog ports on the Arduino). As suggested, we used right-hand wall following to navigate our robot.
