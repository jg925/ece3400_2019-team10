# Milestone 1: Line Following and Figure Eight

This first milestone of the final project required us to rely on the skills
learned in Lab 1 and utilize line sensors to have the robot follow a while line
made with tape on a black background. We chose to use two line sensors, and attached
them as close to the ground as possible near the front of the robot. We made sure
to space them apart so that they were a bit more than the width of the tape apart. You can
see our placement in the photo below; the sensors are attached to the extenders on either side
of the ball bearing.

## The Line-Following Logic

Since we were using two line sensors, we used multiple conditional statements to check each possible
condition for the robot's placement relative to the white lines. If both line sensors were detecting
black, it meant that the robot was on the correct path and would move forward. If only the right
sensor was detecting black, then the left sensor must be drifting right over the line, so the robot
would  make a slight left turn until the left sensor was also detecting black. Likewise, if only the
left sensor was detecting black, then the right sensor must be drifting left over the line, so the
robot would make a slight right turn until both sensors were detecting black again. These slight
turns are executed while the robot is still moving forward. Finally, we have a condition that checks
for both sensors on white, indicating the robot has reached an intersection. This was useful for
debugging and became more prevalent in the second part of the milestone. A video showing a successful
line traversal as well as code showing the algorithm we used to help the robot navigate are below.

## Figure Eight Logic

To have our robot navigate a figure eight, we set up a series of conditional statements within the
first if statement that checks if both line sensors detect white â€“ meaning that the robot is at a
junction. Outside of this function, we declared a global variable called count that would keep track
of what type of turn we wanted the robot to perform: right or left. As a figure eight can be simply
broken down into four right turns and then four left turns (or vice versa), the robot would make right
turns for count values 0-3 and left turns for count values 4-7. After every sequence of four rights and
four lefts, we zeroed out the count variable to allow the navigation of multiple figure eights. To have
the robot execute a turn, we created helper functions rotateRight and rotateLeft which write the same
value to both servos, allowing the robot's wheels to rotate in opposite directions with the same speed.
Since every junction is made up of 90 degree angles, we let the robot rotate for 700 milliseconds which
is about the amount of time needed to make a 90 degree turn. After the turn is finished, the count is
incremented and the figureEight function is done executing. On the next call to this function, the robot
will simply perform the line-following logic that we previously implemented. This is because now that
the turn is finished, the line sensors are no longer detecting white and all of the turn logic will be
skipped. A video showing a successful figure eight traversal as well as code showing the algorithm we used to 
help the robot navigate are below.
